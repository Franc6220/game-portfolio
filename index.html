					<h3>Raycasting</h3>
					<p>Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in realtime, and raycasting was the first solution. Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen. The most well known game that used this technique, is of course Wolfenstein 3D.</p>

				<h2>About the Project</h2>
				<p>
				The inspiration for this project came from my love for retro games and a desire to recreate the classic feel of Wolfenstein 3D in a modern 3D environment. This project was also part of my portfolio for Holberton School.
